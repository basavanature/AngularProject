to generate user defined module -
ng g module products

component inside a module - 
ng g c product/productname

gc(generate component)

by using featuered module angualr the application will become loosly coupled
if i add perticular feature to a module then we dont need to worry about other modules

modularity :) -- deviding the one huge module into serval modules
                or creating a new user module and loosly connecting them

import{common module} contains the ng directives no need to import or anything

AppModule inside this appcomponent
product inside this productdashboard
to export the product module 

in app component==root module, then import first and add that to imprts array.

import and export module and module component 

featuered or user modules are eager in nature it means by rooting these modules in main component all the 
modules load at a time in a browser after the serve after the serve it becomes traficated,
by using lazy loading technique we can load a feature module while it is needed by the user.

user modulecomponent should be exported and user module should be imported

If you want to provide routing for user module then we should use load children property of routes module

In case of main rout  method is forRout,in case of child method is forChild

Lazy loading ---- without user/feature module lazy loading is not possible
remove import from app module
remove export from from the user module
remove the selector tag fom the app component html
parent routing/rout routing==if i want to provide normal routing then {path:"',products,loadChildren:''
inside the feature module i have to assign the child routing{path"", }

[router and router should be inside the array of module.ts]
